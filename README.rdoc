= Hoptoad Server

This is a simple Redmine plugin that makes Redmine act like a Hoptoad server. All exceptions caught and sent by HoptoadNotifier will create or update an Issue in Redmine.

== Installation & Configuration

Just install the Plugin following the general Redmine plugin installation instructions at http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Plugins.

Then, go to Administration -> Settings -> Incoming emails in your Redmine and generate an API key.

Now, download and install the HoptoadNotifier following the excellent instructions on their github page http://github.com/thoughtbot/hoptoad_notifier.

When it comes to creating your config/initializers/hoptoad.rb file, deviate from the standard and put in something like this:


  HoptoadNotifier.configure do |config|
    config.api_key = {:project => 'my_redmine_project_identifier', # the identifier you specified for your project in Redmine
                      :tracker => 'Bug',                           # the name of your Tracker of choice in Redmine
                      :api_key => 'my_redmine_api_key',            # the key you generated before in Redmine (NOT YOUR HOPTOAD API KEY!)
                      :category => 'Development',                  # the name of a ticket category (optional.)
                      :assigned_to => 'admin',                     # the login of a user the ticket should get assigned to by default (optional.)
                      :priority => 5                               # the default priority (use a number, not a name. optional.)
                     }.to_yaml
    config.host = 'my_redmine_host.com'                            # the hostname your Redmine runs at
    config.port = 443                                              # the port your Redmine runs at
    config.secure = true                                           # sends data to your server via SSL (optional.)
  end

You're done. You can start receiving your Exceptions in Redmine!
